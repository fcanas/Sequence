Reinventing ~~the wheel~~ ~~declarative~~ everything. You should probably stay away.

## Usage

To run the tests, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

Sequence is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), though you'd be insane to use it. To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "Sequence", git: 'https://github.com/fcanas/Sequence.git'
